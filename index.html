      <p>To someone who truly understands me and has never let me down for almost 7 years now, it honestly feels like I've known you forever. At this point I'm kinda convinced there's no better pair of best friends than you and me.
        
        <p> </p>You're someone who really cares about me, and you've been by my side through every high and low. Meeting you in person and spending those 9 days together was one of the best times of my life so far. Even before meeting you, I always felt the same way about our friendship—it was just as real even before we met this year. Whether we talk every day or not, whether we meet every year or not, it doesn't matter. I just know I have you.</p>

      <p>Thank you for those 9 days, for letting me stay with you, showing me around Kuala Lumpur, and treating me like family. Introducing me to your friends and making me feel so at home meant the world to me. No matter who I'm hanging out with, I’ve always felt like something was missing, but with you, I feel completely comfortable, because we're both stupid at the same level I guess lol.</p>

      <p>Honestly, I never expected you'd bring me flowers to welcome me at the airport, that was the sweetest thing ever plus making reels for me and making highlights for me on instagram, it was all so sweet. 
        
        <p></p>I remember being on the phone with you just before I left, and as my signal slowly cut off while I got closer to my flight, it hit me how much I was going to miss you. It felt so lonely after I boarded, and looking out the window from the plane, I realized I had just spent the best 9 days of my life, making memories with you.</p>
      <div class="gallery">

      <p>You really understand a lot about people's feelings, and sometimes you kinda surprise me with your brains. Even though you've got ADHD, you're really smart and sweet as a friend and person. There's only four people in my life that I genuinely love and care about, and you're one of them. I hope life treats you well & I want you to know that even if the whole world turns its back on you, I will always be there for you, through thick and thin. You can always trust me—always here as your big brother, best friend, and if anyone messes with you, they're messing with me too. Diskol dhan.</p>

      <p>I wish you good luck in your career and life in general, and I want to see you succeed and live life to its fullest—I know you will.... Sometimes I get really bored and I feel like attending weddings, so get married soon and invite me, hehe. And I’m going to be the godfather of your kids—not anyone but me! I called it first! Happy birthday once again, I really wish I could be there in KL to celebrate your 21st birthday, but it’s okay. In Lanka, we’ll celebrate and add more to our legacy, hehe.</p>
